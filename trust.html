chat to our host for this conversation chilean gupta as a research associate at harvard
4:50
business school and she's joined by her co-author and author of the power of trust sandra sutter she's a professor of
4:57
management practice at harvard business school chalene sandra so happy to have you and
5:03
i'm looking forward to learning more about your book thank you so much colin sander and i are
5:08
so excited to be here especially because this was completely unexpected so i'm just going
5:14
to start off with the story of how we came to be studying trust so a long time ago in a galaxy far far
5:20
away i decided that i was tired of corporate jobs i just felt like injustices happened between closed doors there was
5:26
too much politics i was like i'm done i'm going to become a starving novelist it's going to be wonderful
5:32
the only problem with that is you do in fact become a starving novelist so i had to get a job
5:37
and i ended up going to work for sandra and at the time sandra had two different streams of research one was on layoffs and the
5:44
other was on moral leadership and there was a lot in her work about best practices and what companies
5:50
should be doing and i just fell in love with it and i remember thinking wow if companies did all of these best
5:56
practices i would still stay at corporations i really loved working i wanted to work it
6:02
was just a lot of the policies and hierarchies that seemed unfair drove me crazy and so sandra and i went
6:08
to japan to research a company that had an absolutely marvelous policy for how it treated
6:14
its employees it asked them from day one why are you here and then managers were
6:20
tasked with the question of figuring out what their employees were passionate about and coming up with a task that tied to the company's
6:27
bottom line so the companies could do so the employees could do what they're passionate about and also help the
6:32
company gain revenue and the whole time during that trip i started thinking why are we here
6:38
why is sandra here and at that time sandra was working on a book on layoffs
6:44
and the last day of our trip i turned to sandra in the hotel and i said are you sure you want to write a book on
6:50
layoffs i think there's a much better story here one about trust and how companies can become trusted
6:57
and then i paused and then i realized oh my god i've been working for sandra for six months i am probably about to get fired and i
7:05
had deep regrets and then sandra turned to me and said let's do it
7:10
i think that's a great idea and that's how we started writing about trust and it all began with a moment of trust
7:16
between two people because at that time i had built up enough trust in sandra to realize
7:21
oh my gosh she's somebody i can actually tell this to and so thank you very much sandra for listening to that initial
7:26
crazy question and not firing me yeah so um
7:34
i love our origin story because it really taught us so much
7:40
about trust and it's very hard to move into this space you know you'll all be thinking
7:46
this is entrepreneurs uh if you're not sort of thinking about well what's a situation which i've had to trust
7:52
someone else right and why would i do that uh and what happened when i did
7:58
uh and so this this situation between the two of us really taught me a lot about trust uh and how it
8:05
operates and you know chalene doesn't mention the fact that she's a past fortune reporter
8:10
uh that she is a journalist and a novelist in her own right and she was a fulbright scholar and so
8:16
it's like she she was smart right and a great person to work with so it wasn't like i was making like a
8:22
foolish bet i was trusting her for something we'll talk about later which is for her competence and for
8:28
uh how well-intentioned she seemed to be uh and also how fair she was i mean she
8:33
didn't ask this question of me like with a lot of people looking on it was like you know
8:38
just the two of us in this big hotel lobby uh and so no witnesses uh and the impact
8:44
was that she really helped me think about really quickly what it was that i wanted to focus on
8:51
and you know how important focus is in the lives that you lead and so this was a huge moment to kind of
8:56
go wow left turn here let's go for it uh but i would never have come to this if it hadn't been for shaleen
9:03
there it is an action nobody listens the way sandra does and so actually let's just take a step back sandra speaking of trust can you
9:10
give us a concrete definition because we throw that word around a lot but it becomes quite difficult to actually pin it down
9:17
yeah so so the the story we just told is a great example so trust is vulnerability right
9:25
when we trust we are vulnerable to another person's actions uh toward us uh meaning that i fire
9:31
shalene for example after asking that question sorry and also uh their intentions so chalene
9:39
had to trust at that moment that i was well intentioned toward her
9:44
and that i had her best interest at heart and i did too so so trust is this relationship of
9:50
vulnerability where we're counting on people to do things we can't do for ourselves i would never have asked that question
9:57
if shelene hadn't put the question to me and but because i'm vulnerable at that
10:02
moment that's why trust can be betrayed it's not just like i'm disappointed
10:07
you know if something goes south and i'm trusting it's like okay i feel really lousy here i have been betrayed so trust
10:13
is a relationship of vulnerability to other people's actions and and why is
10:18
that important for entrepreneurs why should we care about trust so so the research on this is
10:25
really helpful for entrepreneurs so you all lead teams right and so there's
10:30
this great study of 30 ncaa basketball teams and what they looked at was what
10:36
difference did it make if the teams had co confidence and trust in their coach and
10:42
what they found in the study was that the teams that trusted their coaches uh won more of their games than
10:48
the trusted didn't in particular the team that had the most trust in his coach won the most games and in fact won
10:55
the championship uh and the team with the lowest trust uh in their coach one just ten percent of
11:00
their games so the first reason why it matters is that these teams that you're leading now they're gonna really do better if
11:07
they trust you so that's point one uh point two is that you'll make more money
11:12
so so there's this great uh study about holiday inns where the researchers
11:19
were trying to figure out what impact did various managerial behaviors have on performance on in particular on
11:26
revenues uh and what they found was that an eighth of a point increase
11:31
in a rating which was on a one to five scale uh interest correlated to uh 2.5
11:38
let me make that a number 250 000. increase in revenue
11:44
uh so and they found that no other element had as much of a focus on an impact on revenue uh as trust in the
11:51
manager did uh so point one your teams are gonna do better 0.2 you're going to make more
11:57
money and point three is you're actually going to live in a better place if your country is good at trust
12:05
and so the world bank did a study of 29 different market economies and what they found was that a 10
12:10
rise in trust uh correlated with nearly a one percent increase in gdp now one percent increase
12:17
in gdp is huge uh and so trust has that scaling effect in that it really affects
12:24
the way that our economy works so that's another reason to contribute to it uh if you're an entrepreneur
12:32
so sounds like trust is extremely important but whose job is it to implement it in an organization yeah so
12:39
you know if i were you in listening you know here's here's the sorry truth uh you are really responsible for
12:47
building an environment in which people trust your organization and you right this is nobody else's job
12:53
you can't outsource this you can't have a board member do this for you you can't find a consultant
12:58
that's going to do it for you this is something that you actually have to manage and
13:03
so speaking of managing this if you're looking for a mentor then as an entrepreneur what are your tips on how to find one
13:08
sandra and how to get a mentor so uh so i was thinking because uh the
13:14
people were nice enough to say we're gonna ask you a question about mentorship what's really important for entrepreneurs and
13:19
and so uh so i have just because i've been around for a long time mentored a lot of people students
13:25
my current mentee who is my favorite is my daughter-in-law uh and my daughter-in-law is an entrepreneur in her own right
13:31
uh and the and so she i thought about the three things that she does that actually helped me be glad to be her
13:38
mentor uh so the first thing that she does is that she's efficient so she's very clear and specific and
13:45
what her ask is and usually the ask are pretty limited a lot of times it's a harvard business
13:50
school case that she's interested in that she wrote about that she read about uh and can i get her the case
13:56
the second is that she's really mindful of my schedule and my ability to respond uh and so you
14:03
know she comes with a concrete request she understands if i'm underwater and that i can't get to it right away
14:09
and the third thing that she's great about is that she's appreciative in the way she shows that as she tells me what
14:14
happened you know because i read this case uh here's what i picked up from that that i
14:20
actually wouldn't have thought of before so i think you know one of the tricks here is to be
14:26
a really good mentee and that there are some things you can do that really make your mentor glad to
14:33
be someone who is mentoring you wisdom of the ages right there from sandra
14:39
so we know that leaders have to build trust and find a trusted mentor but what do we look for when we decide
14:46
whether or not to trust a company so i'm going to use uber as an example
14:53
just because it's i think easier to think about trust in a particular circumstance and so uh one of the things
15:00
that uh we know about trust is that it's not just one thing right so trust as it turns out
15:08
trust in a company is multi-faceted then chalene and i found our research it's their four dimensions to it
15:14
the first is competence right so no one is going to trust your business if you're not good at the thing that you
15:21
say you're going to be good at and uber is unbelievably great at getting us from point a to point b the reason
15:28
why uber owned nearly 90 percent of us ride hailing was because they built such an
15:34
amazing series of systems to understand who we were where we needed to go
15:39
how to create a payless ride for us how to track what it is that we're doing
15:45
so they were unbelievably competent but i don't know about you i myself
15:51
have kind of second thoughts about how much business how much of my business i'm going to give to uber
15:57
and that's because trust is more than just competence you know if trust for competence alone we'd all be in uber
16:03
really happily but there are some things that we know about how uber's operated in the past
16:08
that makes it hard for us to trust them fully uh so the first thing is you know there's this question of
16:15
motives so we care about your competence and then we really care about uh who it is whose interest you serve
16:22
now so there's amazing awful story about uber in 2013 a driver ran into a six-year-old
16:29
girl killed her uh injured her mother and brother now the case went to trial and when it
16:35
went to trial uber said well guess what you know what that guy who was driving he wasn't an
16:41
uber driver at the time of the accident and you know why because he didn't have an uber passenger in his car
16:47
and he hadn't yet accepted his next ride so if you're trying to understand motives what has just happened is uber
16:54
has thrown this driver under the bus refused to acknowledge any responsibility for the people who were
17:00
harmed and really is just out to protect its own interests the next thing that matters is whether a
17:06
company is fair uh whether it uses fair means to achieve its goals and so in one year
17:12
uber asked its drivers to book and then cancel 5 000 rides on lyft
17:19
now the name of the game and ride hailing is showing up on time and so if you're willing to ask your
17:25
employees on your behalf to disrupt the operations of your competitor that's not fair uh and so this is a
17:33
question that that also has people kind of going gosh i don't love how these guys do business
17:39
i don't like the way that they treat the people who they do business with and the last thing is is impact and and
17:45
here that uh this is a story about a woman who wrote a blog post so she was a
17:51
reliability engineer at uber she wrote a blog post in 2017 and talked about
17:57
how awful it was to be a female engineer at uber and how sexist the environment
18:03
was so when she started women were 25 of the engineers in her division when
18:09
she left women were 6 now uber didn't intend for that to
18:14
happen now that's not something where they set out to say how can we make an environment which is really lousy for
18:20
women to work in but the impact of their actions uh was something that actually yielded this
18:26
result and and so if any of you are thinking well that sounds pretty dodgy but does it really matter
18:32
so here's what's happened since then now uber started with 90 percent or more of their us ride-hailing market
18:39
it's now down to two-thirds and who owns the other third it's lift and how did lyft get there
18:45
just by not being uber right and so if you want to cultivate long-term relationships with your
18:51
customers i am with your employees for that matter being trusted is really an important thing
18:56
and uber shows you what happens if you're not trusted over time and so what can a company like uber do
19:03
once they've lost trust is all hope lost so one of the great myths of trust which
19:10
which you know uh shalene which we found out is that this notion that trust
19:15
once lost can never be regained that it turns out is just not true
19:20
uh number one that you know most companies not entrepreneurial companies necessarily
19:25
are so well capitalized that even vw can withstand
19:30
uh what happened to to them in terms of the dieselgate uh and come out the other side uh but
19:37
companies who are trying to recover from trust they're like three processes that we found that are important the first is
19:43
you actually have to apologize now this is not something that most of us signed up
19:48
for uh when we became leaders but in fact the first stage of recovering trust is
19:55
to say i know what i did wrong i'm very sorry i did this thing that was wrong
20:00
here's an explanation for why it is that i did this thing and here's my offer of repair
20:06
here are the things i'm going to do in the future to try to not have this happen again so boeing had done that we'd feel way
20:12
better about getting out of 737 max than we do right now so the first stages is an apology uh
20:20
you know in the middle term uh you actually have to
20:25
deal with issues of who was responsible for what went on so
20:31
companies are hierarchies and people reasonably expect someone to be held accountable
20:36
if there's a problem and in fact you know kalanick was actually finally let go by the board
20:42
and he now there's another ceo in place at uber but they took so long to do that that it
20:48
was hard to give them much credit because so much damage had already been done so stage one apologize
20:54
stage two try to hold the right person accountable for what's gone on uh and stage three is to try to fix the
21:02
things that led to the problem in the first place uh and here you know we know that uber
21:07
has a number of things that they're trying to do to improve their service to try to you know bring
21:12
people rights to covet vaccinations so they're trying to crawl back into some space that's more sustainable
21:20
uh and that fixing of the culture that led to these problems is the third stage so it's apologize
21:26
hold someone accountable and then fix the problem that caused in the first place
21:32
thank you sandra that was wonderful and so thankfully most companies aren't uber and dealing with self-inflicted wounds
21:38
however right now because of the pandemic there are a lot of companies that are in a space where they need to repair trust
21:44
through no fault of their own how should they go about doing that so you know you raise a really good
21:50
point so you know there are two big kinds of trust problems one is a self-inflicted
21:55
wound right i did this to myself and i've gotta find a way to fight back
22:01
uh the other is a trust problem that emerges from a shift in external forces
22:06
uh and so pandemic is like that it's like a recession you know none of you out there caused
22:12
this pandemic in the same way that you wouldn't cause a recession but you have to deal with the consequences the actions that you take
22:20
under the conditions of the recession or in this case the pandemic uh and so yeah i've been thinking uh
22:27
and talking with chalene with you a lot about how it is that companies can move into
22:33
you know people talk about a post-pandemic world i i think that's that's not quite the right way to put it i think we need
22:40
to figure out how to manage in a world where pandemics are now part of our context on an
22:46
ongoing basis so this is not like let's recover from this thing and then we'll be in a new environment
22:52
this is what what kind of processes can we put in place to protect us and the people that we care about given
22:58
that pandemics will wax and wane uh so in my advice to you as entrepreneurs you know if i were
23:05
in your business i'd ask you to ask three questions i'd actually start with your employees
23:11
maybe depending on how many you have uh and also with your customers to find out
23:16
how it is that you're doing right now with respect to your cohort response the first question is how has
23:22
cove had been for you right and that's just data gathering because we really need to understand the
23:28
texture of how this has worked in people's lives the second question is how have we done
23:34
in managing covet you know grade a scale of one to five what have we done well what have we done
23:40
not so well uh and then the third question is what's one challenge that you face
23:45
going forward with respect to covid and pandemics that we can help you with
23:50
that you'd like us to help us with uh and if we ask those questions we'd have much
23:56
better data to work with to understand what's happening right now inside your businesses and what kind of a path you
24:02
need to build going forward you know besides the pandemic it's also
24:09
been a really politically eventful period at least in america we've seen companies take a stand on
24:15
issues like black lives matter stop asian hate and voting rights while others remain silent
24:20
but how should a company figure out when it's time to get political and when silence is actually the best
24:26
course of action so why don't you let me cold call you and ask you
24:32
talk about your experience in researching stop asian hate because this is something that you did a
24:38
lot of work in to try to figure out how it is that companies are responding how people feel about their response
24:45
absolutely so i did an article about companies reactions to stop asian hate and what i
24:50
did is i went and i surveyed employees about how they felt about their company's actions and what i was surprised by was there
24:56
was actually a divide by industry so employees who worked for healthcare companies actually said that
25:03
they were they expected their company to do something because their company was in a field where they had to reduce inequality
25:10
and they had to work with people in society however employees at tech companies had lower expectations because they felt
25:16
like they were doing dealing more with the product and less about social ills
25:21
and this isn't to say that you know all employees were happy when their employers did nothing but rather that
25:28
you need to figure out who your stakeholders are as a company what your mission is and figure out how
25:34
that cause ties to it and how your stakeholders will perceive this people were a lot less forgiving in the
25:39
healthcare companies yes yeah oh sandra anything to add to that i i
25:46
cut you off so i was i was trying to apologize for that uh no i i think that that
25:52
is actually the way to navigate this terrain so there's one question which is sort of
25:58
how big is this harm right and that's just an absolute moral judgment that you make
26:05
as a company about the nature of the issue the second is how close am i to that
26:12
right and so as shalin just said you know healthcare way closer to protecting employees or so
26:18
it feels if i'm an employee with respect to stop asian hate uh and
26:23
so this question about how close you are it's really how close people perceive you to be
26:28
to the issue and what expectation they have uh and then the third is what can you actually do uh and here
26:36
you know i feel that companies have a lot more influence at least within their span of control
26:42
you know over their customers uh and how they engage with them and certainly with their employees
26:48
uh so you know i don't know if many entrepreneurial businesses are going to stand up and say i'm going to fight
26:54
some legislation that has to do with restricting voting rights in my community but it may be that if you have
27:00
a platform and a business relates to that you know it may very well be something that you want to
27:06
consider what we know from the people who do this is that you will get people on both sides coming at you
27:12
some people will be really happy you spoke up other people not so much and so i think that's why
27:17
the companies that tend to wade into these waters are bigger and they tend to have more protections
27:23
around them in terms of capital and all the other things but it doesn't mean i mean some companies like ben and jerry's
27:30
patagonia i mean they build their brands by taking a particular stance and so i
27:36
think that you shouldn't be afraid of it it's more a question of how native is this to what you're trying to accomplish
27:43
and so sandra what's your biggest piece of advice to entrepreneurs who are looking to build trust
27:48
uh so i i i think that the to me the most important thing that i've
27:53
learned about trust is that it's actually pretty limited right so we think about trust is this
27:58
glue that holds us all together we feel so great it's not really like that you know i trust uber to take me in
28:05
a car and take me downtown to my hairdresser right and so that's all i'm asking uber
28:12
to do so i'm not asking them to walk winston my dog you know to make a meal for me
28:18
and so if i'm a business leader if i'm an entrepreneur what you're counting what
28:23
we're counting on you to do is to manage trust within the domains that matter right and so that's the place to start
28:30
you know what are your critical processes which stakeholders really matter to you under what conditions
28:36
uh and you know one question that you can start asking kind of routine routinely is well this
28:42
decision this action i'm about to take win me trust or lose me trust and with
28:47
whom right and so that's a way to kind of make this quite operational
28:52
and pragmatic and think about building it into just the normal questions you are going to ask yourselves about
28:59
decisions you have to make anyway thank you so much for that sandra i'm
29:05
going to move on to some of these pre-submitted questions that we got uh first of all our audience would like
29:11
to know what would you tell your younger self oh sorry
29:18
you know for some of us you know that's that requires quite a lot of thinking back
29:23
uh i i think i tell myself it's gonna be okay right i think when i was young i was so
29:30
worried about you know will i be successful will i be able to accomplish any of the things that i think about
29:36
uh and it turns out that you know that i i think you can actually do quite a lot
29:42
but you don't know that when you're starting out uh and so some of it is just to give yourself permission for how
29:48
uncertain this is but how basically you know you're in charge of that and you can make some of these things
29:55
happen so so you know i think i would have told the young sandra it's okay don't fuss so much and
30:00
just go ahead and do the things that you think you want to do and let's kind of see what happens
30:06
you know current day shalini needed to hear that too so thank you because
30:13
next up besides what we see on paper or linkedin what other due diligence can i do before
30:18
i offer the letter of employment to a key team member um that's a great question uh you know i i
30:27
think that most of you are probably skilled at the behavioral interview
30:32
you know and i have always found that asking people about to tell you about situations that
30:38
they've been in and how they've handled them is really a critical
30:43
window into how it is that they do business routinely uh and you know you can ask that twice
30:51
you know you can say tell me a good story about tell me a not so great story about uh but the trick is to try to say if
30:58
this person were really working inside my organization this is what i'd want to know which is
31:03
how did they operate you know when the chips are down and all that so i would ask them to tell stories
31:09
about things that they've done and then you can sort of step back from that and generalize and sort of say well this
31:14
might be at least some window into how the person operates i'm going to add a flip side to that
31:20
which is when sandra was interviewing me for a job she asked a question that instant i literally said sandra i love
31:27
you i want to work for you after she asked that and it was what can i do as a boss that will drive you completely nuts
31:34
and i loved it no one had ever bothered to ask me that before and there are in fact like a couple
31:39
little things where sandra's she's agreed not to do them and i am so happy to work for her because i
31:45
can just be really honest about those things and then do the best work that i can do for her yeah and shelene's being too kind you
31:52
know my reliability factor on those things that drive her crazy i'd say i'm a maybe 70 percent on a good day uh but
31:59
nonetheless being able to talk about that stuff that's huge right yeah this open honest conversation
32:06
so rare in business but so important yeah yeah and then we've got another question about
32:11
as a bootstrap startup building trust is tough with the lack of cash flow how do i get it
32:20
so i'm not sure actually i feel like there's a question behind that question
32:26
uh and the question behind that question is what am i allowed to do if i'm not making that much money you
32:33
know am i allowed to lie uh and to tell people i'm making more money than i am
32:38
uh am i allowed to exaggerate uh or am i allowed to at least be optimistic
32:44
about my prospects going forwards and and there's a spectrum there you know from things that are outright
32:50
untrue to being optimistic which is part of your job as an entrepreneur about
32:56
the opportunity that you see and where you feel you are on that so i think it's a really important
33:01
question to ask because there is some mind drawing that you're going to want to do you know part of this issue of fair means is are
33:07
you giving people enough good information to make a decision about whether you're going to
33:13
be successful or even to do business with you uh and so really being
33:18
you know optimistic and candid about how things are going and where
33:23
you're headed i think that that will help you but i can certainly understand i think the motivation behind the question i
33:29
hope i haven't insulted the person who asked the question by inferring that that was the question
33:34
you were actually getting at it struck me as a great answer and so
33:40
there you go and then so we've got one in the chat which goes i understand what you're trying to say with your uber example
33:47
however i don't know your motivation for how you are representing uber are you recommending a company apologize when
33:52
they have nothing to apologize for because the scenario can be framed poorly by an adversary
33:58
so i i'm so glad that that you asked that i actually saw that question in chat and i thought that's it that's a really
34:04
thoughtful that i appreciate who you who asked that question so no
34:10
you know you're not going to apologize for things that you didn't do right you know that that actually
34:17
there's some research that would suggest that that actually makes you appear to be less trustworthy
34:22
because people are going well why are you apologizing for something that you didn't do that's like weird
34:27
and doesn't help what i am advocating is that there is a point of coming to acknowledge things that you
34:35
know have been harms that you've created and that's the case in which i think in order to be trusted
34:41
you do have to make some notion that people understand that you understand that you've created a harm
34:47
that you recognize it uh and that you're sorry for that because if you don't do that then someone says well you don't live in the
34:53
same universe i do you know if you can't see that that was a harm it's hard for me to understand how to
35:00
trust you going forward because you and i see things too differently so please you know this is not like a
35:05
blanket go out and start apologizing to everyone it's more in the event that something has gone wrong
35:11
it's created harm and an effect on some stakeholder that matters to you that's the time where you're going to
35:16
want to try to rebuild trust by among other things apologizing uh and you know in trying to make good
35:23
on that uh so i'll just add one other gloss on that so there are like better and worse ways to
35:30
apologize so one of the things that chalene and i were uh kind of slightly hysterical about is that there's a whole academic literature
35:37
on how it is that you would apologize who knew right you know uh and so it turns out that the three
35:43
things that a good apology has the first is just an acknowledgement of the harm and the fact that you're sorry
35:49
about it so that's how you start now the second is an explanation about what it is that led to that uh and
35:57
so that's not a defensive let me tell you know that's a as i understood this situation here's what it was that seemed to cause
36:04
it from our end and the third is an offer of repair and a lot of times what people are looking
36:10
for at that point is just okay you got it you acknowledged harm you gave me an explanation what are you
36:16
going to do about that and so that's you know that's a complete apology
36:21
uh is it has those three elements and when the researchers tested it against three other elements this was actually
36:27
the most powerful kind of an apology when you do those three things
36:33
got it things to keep in mind for the next apology okay
36:38
so somebody wants to know how would you suggest an early stage
36:43
startup build trust with users and customers i recently founded a startup to help people increase success and
36:48
happiness by developing skills such as communication and emotional intelligence is
36:55
so one of the things and i don't know if this is true of you i'll just say that as i've worked with
37:01
in particular harvard business school students who are entrepreneurs and starting their businesses one of the hardest things for them to do
37:07
is to actually talk with their customers uh so it's very easy to default to
37:14
surveying to uh issues that are kind of looking in general uh and i know from my own experience in
37:21
business and building innovation in various kinds of businesses uh that you actually have to have some
37:27
conversations about how this goes now you so i don't know how much
37:33
uh you're currently in touch with your customers if you say well that's not so helpful
37:38
sandra because i talk to them all the time then i'd kind of dig into the question of well exactly
37:44
what are you trying to find out in those conversations right and how clear are you on the things that they could tell you
37:51
uh that you need to know from them uh because specificity around that you know you start broad and then you keep
37:57
narrowing down to what's the thing i'm really trying to figure out but i think the big rule here is if you
38:02
want to learn more from customers talk to them and find out you know what their experience has been kind of moment by
38:09
moment as they engage with your business it sounds like you're starting a great business people would have a need for so getting
38:15
close to them i think would be great and from the same person how would you
38:21
suggest building trust with team members that have never met in person oh you know that that is that's such a
38:28
great question uh so you know i i think that
38:33
what we know matters and people trusting each other is if trust is vulnerability there has to
38:39
be some way in which people allow themselves to be vulnerable with each other
38:44
and that's easier to do in person than it is on zoom but there does have to be some element
38:50
and by the way this is something where the leader has to demonstrate this right so my specific advice is uh to
38:57
start the next meeting by telling a story about something that happened to you
39:02
that reveals some vulnerability and where you want to sort of create a safe space where people go as well hell if
39:08
she's willing to say that you know i can share things as well and so i i think
39:14
that trying to create an environment in which people are comfortable as comfortable as they can be saying
39:20
things on zoom as they would be if they were in person i think that's sort of the high art
39:26
one of the things for what it's worth that i've learned on zoom in particular is that if i keep the camera in speaker
39:32
mode i'm able to see the person's face large and you know and not focus as much on my
39:38
face and that is a trick that a colleague told me and so it makes actually those engagements with people
39:45
far more intimate because actually you're seeing and talking with them in a very direct way uh so i you know those are two things
39:52
that i can think of i don't know if that's helpful it's just what occurs to me that sandra and i have had some of her
39:57
most vulnerable conversations on zoom so she really means this yeah it's definitely true yeah yeah
40:04
and so here's the scenario someone would like advice on if a business partner has become untrustworthy
40:09
and behavior becomes aggressive due to frustration with delays etc is it worth trying to repair the
40:14
relationship can a leopard change its spots or do we need to figure out an exit and move on hmm
40:22
so so i think that the judgment call there uh is uh a couple of things one is
40:29
how valuable is the person to your business right so if that person has skills that
40:35
nobody else has that you still need you're going to need to back up some plan
40:40
that says to replace those skills i need to do x uh and i need to bring someone else to
40:46
do that so that's the first question the second is how troubling is this behavior
40:51
right you you know there's a range of i gave you a wrong answer once this is a
40:58
pattern where i'm not telling you the truth or i'm not disclosing things obviously if it's a one-off it's useful
41:04
to find that out because people are not perfect you know and so sometimes people actually
41:09
don't behave as well as they'd like to and they can be called out on that if it's a pattern of behavior that you
41:15
see over time i think that's a point to start saying okay this looks like this this leopard can't change its spots uh and
41:22
i'm gonna need to find a new leopard uh and you know and i think that you
41:28
know there that that's just a whole separate process about how you you know sever the relationship with
41:33
that individual but it's definitely a question of is this a pattern or a one-off and how can you verify that your
41:39
judgment at the moment isn't just based on you know two bad weeks in someone's life
41:44
i was just on a call with someone earlier today and i asked him how he was he told me that his son head who is six
41:50
years old had contracted covet now if he hadn't said that i would never
41:56
know that that was what was going on in his mind but if he behaved a little weirdly during that encounter my god i gave him lots of room for that
42:03
to occur so sometimes we don't know what's going on in people's lives and i have definitely parted company with
42:10
people who i feel are not useful to the cause so i'm not saying you know put up with people no matter what it's more just
42:16
making sure sort of what's the basis on which you're making this evaluation
42:22
100 moving on to competition so while trying to disrupt an industry
42:28
how do you compete without comparing yourselves to your competitors um
42:39
so you know i i don't know i don't have a good answer this question i will make something up
42:44
uh and it's either going to make sense or not because i'm thinking of this company
42:51
that we studied recruit holdings in japan uh and so this is a platform matching
42:56
business and they have the equivalent of a marketplace for automobiles for
43:01
education for getting married for ordering dinner and for getting your nails done
43:07
and the only way that they can communicate sort of what nature of the business they're in is to put in a chart you know
43:13
here's this line of business and here's who normally does this as a business unto itself right and so this is like combining this
43:20
business and this business and this business and quite honestly if i hadn't seen that chart i wouldn't know how to evaluate
43:26
how different they were so i think there is some element of needing to help people
43:31
understand what is the comparison and in particular if you're disrupting on what basis are you a disruptor
43:38
right so what's the specific way that you're disrupting and i think that's where you can differentiate but there are probably
43:44
ways in which you're also the same as your competitors right and so i think that that's important but i don't know if that's a
43:50
useful comment or not because i'm kind of uh making that up right now
43:55
if you have follow-ups definitely feel free to submit in the q a so definitely the two-way conversation
44:03
um so speaking of going and buying leopards at the leopard shop
44:08
how would you find a technical team or a co-founder particularly a cto
44:15
oh uh well this is probably something you've already done but i look at everybody else's business
44:23
and kind of see who works for them and i don't mean by the way to go buy that leopard i i then would then start asking who
44:31
does that person know right so if that person's really good at it you know they probably have a network
44:36
of other people uh and so you have to ask permission of the company is it okay for you to have a conversation with this person
44:43
uh because you're not trying to poach them but i think that you know people in a given domain tend to know
44:50
each other uh and you have your own impressions of who's good at this stuff and who's not and also who may be available and who's
44:56
not so i think you sort of start some minor networking through the companies where you think this job is
45:02
doing well there we go and that's how you find the
45:07
leopard at the leopard shop i'm i'm in love with that phrase i'm just gonna keep using it all day
45:14
more specifically with regards to subscription businesses how would you go about retaining customers
45:20
um yeah so that's a question of how to make sure that you know what
45:26
they're thinking right so if you're a subscription business you know you know once i give
45:32
you my money there tends to be a kind of a studied indifference uh to my experience of the business over
45:39
time uh and so i i think that um anybody who is kind of logging on to you in that sense
45:46
if you care about retaining them you're going to want to have more customer inquiry than you might think is
45:51
necessary given the business model that you're in in order to try to understand what's
45:57
working for people and what's not and those are like individual conversations you know that you would
46:02
have with x number of people on a weekly or monthly basis just to have your finger on the pulse of
46:08
what it is that they're thinking because i think that you can't just imagine what's going on in their minds you actually have to ask
46:15
and just to echo sandra because i spent a very brief amount of my time working with subscription businesses so first of all you know it's
46:22
a recurring product or service so you have to make sure that there's a consistent flow of quality and that you're consistently
46:28
meeting the customer's need as you said so checking in that there's no break and the quality or how you're meeting something um and
46:35
then secondly you know with regard to conversions and subscription renewal you've got to make sure that it's the
46:40
right price aimed at the right customer at the right time and we're seeing more and more personalization of pricing
46:47
uh but there is a way in which you know different people have their different price points and
46:52
something that's surprising is it's not necessarily a cheaper price point that will get you the customer sometimes
46:59
they place more value in something that's priced a little higher and
47:05
brief theory in my life i looked at a ton of data about this wow um so moving on what if trust is
47:12
compromised in a partnership in your experience what are the key red flags to identify before considering
47:18
ending the relationship possession position or even venture uh well
47:24
you know i would recommend actually parsing the concerns that you're having
47:31
through this framework of is this a question of competence uh is it motives
47:36
is it whether the person uses fair or unfair means and how they go about doing business and what's the actual impact of their
47:43
behavior inside the company and the reason why chalene and i built this framework up from
47:50
studying companies and leaders who do a good or bad job with trust was to try to make it operational so we
47:56
tried to build something that would actually were questions that you could ask to interrogate a problem
48:02
and so this is a great example of giving yourself four different slices of trying to understand what's the nature of this
48:09
relationship and where is it not working uh and the more of those things very kind not good they're
48:14
not good they're not good there it just will build more confidence in your judgment about what to do
48:22
you know so i don't think you're asking us to you know say how should you go about doing that it's more on what basis
48:27
would you make the call and then we've got a follow-up to an
48:32
earlier question so the earlier question was how do you suggest an early stage startup build trust with users and customers
48:40
there was a clarification which was thank you very much for your answer good point on vulnerability my first question is actually about how
48:46
to convert website visitors into users customers or convert users customers and to return customers
48:53
assuming we need to build trust with them first so um i think we are rapidly uh getting
49:02
to my point of not being able to be useful so i want to be sort of clear about what
49:08
i know and what i don't know uh and and so i think this question
49:13
about how you can convert customers at different stages along the path of doing business with
49:19
you that you what i know from my own experience in business and the businesses i've studied is that the principle of being close to
49:26
the customer at the points of interaction and the times of interaction is what gives you the information that
49:32
you need and so usually if you're asking a question about how should this happen i'd start again by going back into the
49:38
customers and finding some way to start getting some data for yourself on the moments in which they are doing
49:44
business with you at these different stages and trying to understand what factors they're taking into account
49:49
as they're making a decision about whether or not they do business with you uh and so the people who decide to kind of come back
49:56
again that would be a group i would go back to and try to understand why did they make that decision
50:01
what was it that they were thinking about as they were doing that and all the way along the path if there was some way to go back to some of the
50:08
people who didn't sign up again and just trying to figure out well why not you know what was going on there
50:14
kind of like an exit interview for customers uh so i i again i i feel like it's hard
50:19
to imagine those things i think the only way you can do it is to start getting a healthy dose of some
50:25
information that you can then start to make decisions around i'm also going to add big data as your
50:30
friend here and av i'm just figuring out what are the different scenarios what are people with
50:36
the same characteristics behaving like what do they do in the different situations depending on if you
50:41
change one parameter or another great point yeah
50:46
more blood let's see some good ones
50:54
are businesses which embrace transparency more trusted i is so um
51:01
i would say in general yes i i have a colleague who does really
51:07
interesting research on what he calls operational transparency and what he's
51:12
found in his research as a professor named brian buell is that if you reveal
51:18
for example some of the work that goes into the product in particular the service
51:23
that a customer sees they actually have more appreciation for that service than if there was a black
51:29
box uh and so that's it and he calls this operational transparency because it's
51:35
literally like trying to put a camera over the shoulder of the company as it's doing its work
51:40
and trying to show all the work that goes into it and if you're building good processes to
51:46
make things happen that would strengthen the cause and people's ability to understand what it
51:52
is what's under the hood uh so i think that kind of transparency is useful uh and i i don't know kind of where the
51:59
limit is to that i would imagine that there is some limit around transparency but i'd have to think more about the
52:05
question myself before i'd give an answer another question if we're an impact
52:12
driven company that wants to ensure the quality standards are being upheld by vendors that we work with that usually requires
52:19
asking a series of questions that can come off as distrust how do you do this right
52:25
sandra this makes me think about patagonia yeah go for it yeah yeah why don't you want to talk about that yeah sure so
52:32
we did some research on patagonia which prides itself in having a very robust
52:38
supplier network and having an extremely rigorous um line of values that they adhere to
52:44
whether it's environmental or how their goods are being produced and so they were auditing their first-line suppliers and realized
52:52
there were some issues and they decided you know what we're going to go even deeper into our supply chain and they looked at the raw material suppliers
52:59
and they were horrified to discover that actually there was um indentured labor being used and that
53:06
they were hiring and the raw material factories were hiring um employees by using a headhunter that
53:13
charged exorbitant fees and then the employees couldn't pay them off so they were basically trapped and patagonia said this is basically
53:21
not acceptable and they worked together with the governments of the countries they were in to stop
53:26
this they went through a rigorous process of auditing their first level suppliers and they actually tried to
53:32
start a consortium in the retail business to ensure that other companies went through the same
53:37
process and it was actually kind of disheartening because other retailers said no we're not going to do this
53:43
so it's only patagonia but i would say that there's more trust in patagonia that certainly converted me into a
53:50
consumer and a customer of patagonia because you know that they're doing the due diligence and sometimes you have to do
53:56
the due diligence and ask the questions otherwise you don't know what's going on
54:01
right right and i think that for patagonia's it probably would be for your business
54:06
this was a compliment to external people whose job it was to go there and to do
54:11
their due diligence and to look at whether or not their uh standards were being complied with
54:17
and the reason why patagonia went this route is that they were just starting to get some feedback that said that they
54:22
think that those who as good as those reports were they got interested in whether or not they were
54:28
learning the whole story so that's why they went in themselves to start to audit uh first at the top level and then as
54:34
shalene just described it the next level down and so i i think you know very good
54:40
people are in the business of trying to figure these things out on your behalf but there may very well be times when
54:46
you're going to want to double up on that if you really care about it and see you know is there something you can find out
54:52
if you were the ones that asked the question it's going to be harder because people are less likely to be candid with you
54:58
uh than they might be with a third party uh but i i think that given you know good intent
55:03
and a way of sort of con dealing with people on a human basis you may be able to find some things you
55:08
wouldn't know otherwise so another question trust obviously
55:13
builds confidence has this changed the way that you view opportunities do you find yourself saying yes more to
55:19
more engaged more or more engaged or engaging more with opportunities more quickly so
55:27
um i i think that that's a very good connection it's definitely true that if you step
55:34
into this area you start to get a feel for how your relationships work and what allows
55:40
those relationships to be more successful and how to build trust within them
55:45
and that does give you more confidence to kind of step off the path with some other people and
55:51
say okay let's see if we can do this thing right because there's definitely an aspect to trust which is
55:58
it allows things to happen that literally couldn't happen if trust weren't in the room
56:03
so you know if you go back to the dawn of time and think about facebook think about uber all of these were bets on trust uh and
56:10
so i i think that this notion that trust allows you to do things that you couldn't do otherwise i think is a
56:15
really good way to think about it and just to wrap up with one final question
56:22
based on your experience while studying business what are your top pieces of advice for
56:27
success no god uh
56:33
you know i i think that uh i'm a big believer in self-cultivation so
56:41
you know i think that personal success is built on treating yourself as a
56:46
project that can be improved all the time and that this is something where it's not like you reach a certain age and
56:53
it's done and being quite mindful about what it is that you're working on at any given
56:58
stage in your career is really helpful so you know it for this period of time this next six months here are the things
57:05
i'm working on for myself to get better at uh and i think that having some kind of

a program for self-development and self-cultivation actually builds
57:15
your skills over time in a way that if you kind of assume that that's going on but don't treat it quite as seriously
57:22
you're kind of counting on something that may or may not be happening so i would definitely sort of look to
57:27
some notion of what it is that you think you need to improve at various stages and build up a plan for how you're going
57:34
to do that how you're going to know if you're going to make progress on that and i think we are much more capable of
57:39
being developed than we think we are if we take this more mindful approach
57:45
